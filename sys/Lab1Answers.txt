1)
Round Robin:
**Advantages:
  -Extremely simple
  -Ensures highest priority processes are executed ASAP
  -Ensures processes with equal priority take turns executing
**Disadvantages:
  -Processes with lower priorities are not executed until all processes with
	higher priorities finish executing
  -Starvation is likely

Aging:
**Advantages:
  -Still fairly simple
  -Attempts to let high priority processes execute soon
  -Allows priority of low priority processes to slowly grow as they are not executed as to
	attempt to avoid starvation
**Disadvantages:
  -Starvation can still occur for a while, although no process will never starve completely
  -Starvation could even occur in high priority processes. Although they will eventually
	execute, their executions could be few and far between if there are many processes
	competing with it

Linux-like:
**Advantages:
  -Ensures all processes get a chance to execute periodically
  -Weights execution time based on priority, so higher priority processes get more time
  -Processes which are blocked for some reason are allowed to carry some portion of their
	remaining time over
**Disadvantages:
  -Far more complex
  -Rescheduling takes a lot of time

2) All of the scheduling policies affect the NULL process in more or less the same way. They all
use a very low priority to ensure that the NULL process is not executed, performing idle work
while there is actual useful work to be done. Despite the same affect, each policy handles the
NULL process in a different way.

**Round robin: Since the NULL process has a priority of 0, it will not be executed if there are
any other processes on the queue since they will have a priority over 0.
**Aging: This policy handles the NULL process very similar to round robin with the added fact
that the NULL process' priority of 0, when multiplied by 1.2 is still 0, so it's priority will
never grow, so it will never be chosen to run if there are other processes in the queue.
**Linux-like: Since the NULL process has a priority of 0, no quantum time is alloted to it and
the other processes, which do have quantum, will be given time to execute. If there are no
other processes, then the NULL process will be selected despite the fact it has no quantum.
